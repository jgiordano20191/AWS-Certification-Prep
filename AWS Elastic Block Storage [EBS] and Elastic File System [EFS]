1.  Exam Tips - EBS Overview


-Exam TIps:  Learning EBS:  SSD Volumes
  Highly available and scalable storage volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance
  Gp2 (general purpose ssd)
    Suitable for boot disks and general applications
    Up to 16,000 per volume
    Up to 99.9% durability
  
  Gp3 (general purpose ssd)
    Suitable for high performance applications
    Predictable 3000 iops baseline performance and 125 MiB/s regardless of volume size
    Up to 99.9% durability
    NOTE:  In exam never be asked IOPS of MiB/s

2.  Exam tips - Volumes and Snapshots

Snapshots:
    - Sharing Snapshots - you can share snapshots, but only in the region in which they were created.  To share to other regions, you will need to copy them to the destination region first.
    - Exam - tons of scenerio questions on how to move ec2 instances from one region to another:  take a snapshot and create a copy of that snapshot, and copy to another region, 
      thenyou can provision that ec2 instance in other region

What should you know about EBS volumes
Location - EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as EC2
Your EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance to which it is attached

5 Tips for EBS Volumes and Snapshots
Volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3
Snapshots are point in time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature
The first snapshot will take some time to create. consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volumes. 
You can share snapshots between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region
You can resize EBS volumes on the fly as well as changing the volumes
consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volumes. 

3.  Exam Tips - Protecting EBS Volumes with Encryption

Encrypted Volumes
Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
All snapshots are encrypted
All volumes created front eh snapshot are encrypted

How to encrypt Volumes
Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume
Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot
Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances

4.  Exam Tips - EC2 Hibernation

Exam Tips:  What you need to know about EC2 Hibernation
EC2 hibernation preserves the in-memory RAM on persistent storage (EBS)
Much faster to boot up because you do not need to reload the OS
Instance RAM must be less than 150 GB
Instance families include C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, M5, R3, R4, and R5
Available for Windows, AMazon Linux 2 AMI, and Ubuntu
Instances cant be hibernated for more than 60 days
Available for on-demand instances and reserved instances


5.  Exam Tips - EFS Overview

Exam - just know where and what efs is and when you would use it

Exam Tips
What to Remember about EFS
Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
Only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
Can scale up to pedabytes
Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region
Read after write consistency

If you have a scenario-based question around highly scalable shared storage using NFS, think EFS

6.  Exam tips = FSx overview

EFS
- Exam tip - if you get a question on migrating sharepoint of active directory onto some form of shared storage, immediately think of FSx for Windows

Exam Tips
In the exam, you’ll be given different scenarios and asked to choose whether you whold use EFS, FSx for Windows, or FSx for Lustre

EFS:  When you need distributed highly resilient storage for linux instances and linux based applications

Amazon FSx for Windows:  When you need centralized storage for Windows-based applications such as Sharepoint, Microsoft SQL, Workspaces, IIS Web Server, 
or any other native Microsoft Application

Amazon FSx for Lustre:  When you need high-speed, high-capacity distributed storage.  This will be for applications that do high performance computing (HPC),
financial modeling, etc.  Remember that FSx for Lustre can store data directly on S3.


7.  Exam Tips - Amazon Machine Images:  EBS vs Instance Store

Instance Store Volumes ( Study Tip)
Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage.  Instance store volumes cannot be stopped.  If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.  You can, however, reboot the instance without losing your data.
If you delete the instance, you will lose the instance store volume

EBS-Volumes (Study Tip)
EBS-backed instances can be stopped.  You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.  You can also reboot an EBS volume and not lose your data.
By default, the root device volume will be deleted on termination.  However, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume with EBS volumes.

If you see anything about ephemeral storage, think instance store; if you need consistent and permanent storage think EBS Volumes


Know the diff for exam of ebs volumes and instance store volumes, 

Exam Tips:  AMIs:  EBS vs Instance Store
Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage
Instance store volumes cannot be stopped.  If the underlying host fais you will lose your data
EBS-backed instances can be stopped.  You will not lose the data on the instance if it is stopped
You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes and you will not lose your data
By default both root volumes will be deleted on termination.  However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
Bonus tip - an ami is just a blueprint for an ec2 instance

7.  Exam tips - AWS Backup

Exam Tips
Consolidation:  Use AWS Backup to back up AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, EFS, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, and AWS storage gateway

Organizations:  You can use AWS Organizations in conjunction with AWS Backup to back up your different AWS services across multiple AWS accounts

Benefits:  Backup gives you centralized control, letting you automate your backups and define lifecycle policies for your data.  You get better compliance,
as you can enforce your backup policies, ensure your backups are encrypted, and audit them once complete

You mainly need to kwow what AWS backup is going into exam
